Paragraph Practice In Markdown

If we want to write paragraph in MD we need to keep whole line as a spacing so it detects there is a paragraph.

For example:

one 
two 
three 
four 

these all are written one below each other while making this markdown file but MD doesnt detect till its whole single line

To make it one below each other:

one 

two

three

four
